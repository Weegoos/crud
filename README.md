  1. At the beginning we have to launch the project
  2. After launching the application, follow this link: http://localhost:3000/
  3. After clicking on the link, you will be taken to the main page, then click on the Sign In button
  4. After that, you will be redirected to the registration page: http://localhost:3000/registration. On this page, you can write your name, your email as it suits you. However, you should consider two important points: 
      *  You will not be able to change this name later, as it is fixed, so it is recommended to write a valid name for correct operation further.
      *  The name you write will be displayed on the blog, which other people will see. Therefore, think carefully before you keep your name.
   5. Then you will go to the page: http://localhost:3000/blogs . You can write anything you want on this page, but the fields should not be empty, you must definitely write something so that the server accepts your request.After clicking on the button, if everything happened successfully, you will receive a message: {"success":true,"message":"The blog has been successfully saved"}
   6. Then you can follow the link: http://localhost:3000/read where you can view all your blogs that you have published. Here you can view various information about your blog, and you also have the option to delete the blog or change it depending on your preferences.
